Econometrics Math Camp 2020
=================================

This repository contains the documents that will be used in the econometrics portion of Harvard's economics department math camp for incoming first-year graduate students.

The folder 'Notes' contains a master notes document that covers all of the content we will cover in math camp (and more). The folder 'Slides' contains the main sets of slides that I will present during our sessions. The folder 'Worksheet' contains a document with the problems we'll cover in breakout rooms.
